INSTALLING THE TASKMANAGER APPLICATION:
- Place the binary in the appropriate folder(s) of your operating system, although it is possible to run the application from any directory in the file system.
- Enable the path where you have placed the executable in your system's PATH
- You can now call the application from the terminal in any folder by simply calling the `task` command.

USAGE:
By running `task --help` (or `task -h`) in the terminal you will have a complete list of all the commands you can use.

NOTE:
When starting the application, a hidden file (`.app_data.db`) will be created in your user folder containing a SQLITE database, which stores the application data.
